# EOMAJI
This project aims to implement a prototype for irrigation mapping and crop yield estimation using inputs from the scientific ECOSTRESS and PRISMA missions.

**Hypothesis**: Irrigated agricultural areas can be distinguished from adjacent agricultural parcels or natural areas through sudden increase in soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration which cannot be explained by
other factors (e.g. change in weather or vegetation cover).
