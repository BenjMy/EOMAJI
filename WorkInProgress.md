# Work in Progress


## Processing

### Issues 
- [ ] July calendar only works for matplolib 3.7

### ðŸ’§ Water balance/ Land surface **Synthetic** modeling
- [x] Net irrigation accounting plot 1D
- [ ] July plot with event classification


### ðŸ’§ Water balance/ Land surface **Real field** modeling
- real data EOMAJI's field site:
  - [ ] Spain Majadas
    - [ ] compare hydro simulated with TDR real data
    - [ ] interpretation of ETap ratio local/regional VS rain event
    - [ ] DA with soil and root update during rainfed season

  - [ ] Burkina
    - [ ] ðŸ“Œ Clip to AOI
  - [ ] Botswana
     - [ ] ðŸ“Œ Clip to AOI

## Redaction
- [ ] **WEB**, publish results in myst pages
- [ ] **Poster** Frascati
- [ ] Peer review article:
  - [ ] **Title**: Water accounting in a semi-arid savanna type ecosystem
        - Geophysics + water balance at majadas field site
        - Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES) 
  - [ ] **Title**: Water accounting using WB, EB and DA
        - WB + EB + DA for water accounting in all field sites

## Meeting notes

**July**
- 5000*5000 domain pixels (standard)
- how sensitive is compared to the irrigation amount? try to decrease the irr.
- convert in mm/day
- what about percolation? Inet does not account for it!
- simulating microWaves as well (=only account for the 5cm topsoil moisture, using an adequate CATHY mesh?) to showcase the drawbacks!
- non homogeneous soil conditions! calibrate the hydrological model during the rain season
