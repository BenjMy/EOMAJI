# Abstract


# Background and objectives

In this study, we utilized the CATHY code (Catchment Hydrology, Camporese et al., 2010) for modeling soil surface-subsurface water flow. We conducted experiments involving synthetic scenarios to assess their detectability with:
- varying sizes and levels of irrigation
- different frequencies of evapotranspiration (EO) 
- atmospheric boundary conditions, including rain events occurring between irrigation cycles. 


# Description of the synthetic models

- Regional domain size = 100x100
- Irrigation local size = 30x30


# Results

## Scenario 0
