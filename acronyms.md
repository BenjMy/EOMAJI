A list of common acronyms in irrigation management/water accounting

- NIR: net irrigation requirements
Can be an output in the form of spatially and temporally (daily, monthly) distributed maps 
- IWRM: Integrated Water Resources Management
- RS-IWA: Remote Sensing-based Irrigation Water Accounting
- RBMP: River Basin Management Plan
- SEEA-W: System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.161)
- WFD: Water Framework Directive
Requires achieving good status of groundwater and surface water
- WF: Water footprint
A consumption-based indicator of water use defined as the total volume of water that is used to produce the goods and services consumed by an individual or community (Hoekstra and Chapagain,2008)


**Spatial scales**

- RBD: River Basin District

- ES: Exploitation System 
Water bodies or groups of water bodies that share surface water and groundwater, hydraulic infrastructure installations, and water use and exploitation rules

- ADU: Agricultural Demand Unit
Defined as agricultural surfaces with common characteristics such as geographic locations, water user associations, and irrigation technologies that also share the same sources of water. Their irrigation returns are incorporated into the same zone or sub-zone in the general system. 

- EDU: Elemental Demand Unit
Subdivision of the ADU with common characteristics, such as the same water supply source.

**Model**
- FAO 56
- RS-SWB: Remote Sensing-based Soil Water Balance
- HidroMORE: operational application to implement parallel processing with multithreading for running simulations over large areas (Moreno, R.; Arias, E.; Sanchez, J.L.; Cazorla, D.; Garrido, J.; Gonzalez-Piqueras, J. HidroMORE 2: An optimized and parallel version of HidroMORE. In Proceedings of the 2017 8th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems (ICICS), Irbid, Jordan, 4–6 April 2017; pp. 1–6.)
- MIKE 11 hydrodynamic (DHI. MIKE 11 A Modelling System for Rivers and Channels User Guide; Danish Hydraulic Institute: Hørsholm, Denmark, 2017; p. 510.)
- AQUASTAT: global information system on water resources, quantifies and differentiates human water abstractions based on three use categories: municipal (11%), industrial (19%), and agricultural (70%)
- PATRICAL:  (Pérez-Martín et al., 2014, 10.1007/s11269-014-0755-3) is a large-scale, conceptual, and monthly, spatially distributed (grid 1 × 1 km2) water balance model with water quality that includes: streamflows, river-aquifer interactions, interactions between aquifers, groundwater discharge to wetlands and to the sea and average groundwater levels in aquifers. 
- AQUATOOL Decision Support System (DSS)

**Data**
- Agricultural:
  - River Basin Authority (example: Guadiana, CHG, 2008b)
  - Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 1T sheets (MAPA, 1999; 2001b).
  - Agroalimentary Statistics Yearbook of the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA, 2007)
  - FAO: crop coefficients in different crop development stages (initial, middle and late stage) were taken from FAO (Allen et al., 1998; FAO, 2003)
- Economic data:
  - Gross value added (GVA)  --> River Basin Authority
  - Crop economic value (€/ton) --> Spanish Ministry of Agriculture
- Hydrologic data:
  - water origin (surface and groundwater) --> River Basin Authority
  - blue water withdrawals --> River Basin Authority
