The Earth Observation Science group is an interdisciplinary team working across the Departments of Physics/Astronomy, Chemistry and Geography. The group hosts the Directorate and Leicester science unit of the National Centre for Earth Observation led by Prof. John Remedios. The surface temperature activities of EOS at Leicester are integrated into the NCEO Leicester science unit, benefitting from strategic support at national level. Studies of the ATSR and Sentinel-3 missions are key projects in the Leicester surface temperature team. The Leicester PI team (PI, Prof. Remedios) for ATSR has been leading the ATSR programme since 1993. The PI team have been particularly concerned to support algorithm developments, assess data quality and analyze long-term time series of sea surface temperature, and land surface temperature. ESA awarded the GlobTemperature and Climate Change Initiative Land Surface Temperature projects to a team led by Leicester (PI, Dr. Ghent). The group has been supported by ESA to develop the LST algorithms for AATSR and SLSTR on Sentinel-3, and has produced the latest LST ATBDs for these instruments. In addition, the group is responsible for the latest developments in LST cloud masking for SLSTR, with their algorithm currently being implemented into the operational chain. Through Dr Ghent the team are involved in the S3MPC and provide the SLSTR LST algorithm as well as research on cloud clearing over land. The team are also part of the GBOV (Ground-Based Observations for Validation of Copernicus Land Products). The surface temperature group has become fundamentally involved in the early specification and developments towards a potential new Copernicus mission: Land Surface Temperature Mission (LSTM) with ESA. Dr. Ghent is also a member of the MAG from LSTM. The University of Leicester has been leading the application of ESA and Copernicus EO data on agricultural water management in a series of global challenges UK-India research programmes. As a result the Leicester team has conducted a series of successful stakeholder engagement workshops and panel discussions.","position":{"start":{"line":17,"column":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":1}},"key":"ilUyqqZL7e"}],"key":"wxy3UCwdgB"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"African Early Adopters","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"VuTJFZGqHo"}],"identifier":"african-early-adopters","label":"African Early Adopters","html_id":"african-early-adopters","implicit":true,"key":"zWz37qC8ya"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"strong","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation Development of Burkina Faso (MoABF)","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"key":"qIc3cpQLWt"}],"key":"ju7brAhnJ3"},{"type":"text","value":", ","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"key":"DV6jI8zFye"},{"type":"emphasis","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ministère de l’Agriculture et des Amenagement Hidrauliques","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"key":"oJDe3QSDK9"}],"key":"t8WVwC7zZs"},{"type":"text","value":", is responsible for the implementation of the policies defined by the Government of Burkina Faso regarding agricultural matters.
