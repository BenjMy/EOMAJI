# Highlights
A joint online meeting with all African Early Adopters and the South African EO experts was organized by DHI, in order to better survey their project needs and expectations, and the data they would have available for prototype evaluation.
First tests using crop model simulations showed promising results in predicting wheat yield based on the actual vs. potential evapotranspiration deficit and peak biomass.
ET estimates, using ECOSTRESS LST and TSEB model, were validated at sites from the ICOS Warm Winter 2020 database.

# Upcoming Key Activities for the next 3 months
We are now preparing all deliverables required for MS1. We will submit the deliverables to ESA by the end of April, before the MS1 meeting scheduled for May 4th.
We will participate in the ThermalEO 2023 workshop with an oral presentation entitled "Continuous monitoring of crop water use and productivity by fusing ECOSTRESS, PRISMA and Sentinels as part of the EOAfricaâ€™s Explorers initiative". In addition, two of the EOMAJI members will also attend to the workshop as part of the LSTM Mission Advisory Group.

# Any general happening
A research intern (MSc student) joined AECSIC in March 1st for a total duration of seven months. He will be helping in processing EO biophysical traits and ET and in developing the crop yield models.
Once the first payment is received, after MS1, AECSIC plans to hire a postdoc to help in the EOMAJI research activites.
Vicente Burchard particpated in the  2nd Workshop on International Cooperation in Spaceborne Imaging Spectroscopy, held in Frascati (Q4/2022). There he presented the EOMAJI research lines regarding the use of PRISMA: https://hyperspectral2022.esa.int/iframe-agenda/files/presentation-146.pdf
