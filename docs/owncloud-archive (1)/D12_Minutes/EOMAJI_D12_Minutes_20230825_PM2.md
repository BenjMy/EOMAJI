# EO-MAJI Progres Meeting 2 - Minutes.

## Introduction.
The meeting was held online using ACESIC's videoconference tool. The attendants to the meeting were:

* Radoslaw Guzinski, DHI.
* HÃ©ctor Nieto, AECSIC.
* Darren Ghent, University of Leicester.

The meeting started on time at 9:00 CET. 

# Main Topic
The main discussion topic was on the issue related to the payments by AECSIC to the subcontractors. 

As discussed before the summer holidays, the Spanish State Attorney declared that being AECSIC a public body is subject to the Spanish contracting law with for public entities. This means that any payment/invoice to perform any external service must be make public. This legal contraint makes very difficult for AECSIC to guarantee the payments to the subcontractors and thus the best solution we found and agreed between AECSIC, DHI an ULEIC is to modify the contract to allow University of Leicester to be the prime instead. This CCN was suggested to the ESA Financial Officer but after several contacts we have not receive any reply. 

In this meeting we agreed that we could not delay this issue any more and thus we decided to prepare the Contract Change Notice as soon as possible suggesting the modification of the prime contractor and thus a corresponding modification of the budget distrubtion between partners. 

As for the project progress overview, little progress has been made since the resubmission of the deliverables for MS1, due both to the summer holidays and the uncertainty regarding the CCN.

## Future steps and meetings.
The next steps for the project will be:

1. The submission of the CCN.
2. DHI and ULEIC will work on thermal sharpening activities. ULEIC specifically will focus on sharpening ECOSTRESS 70m LST to the ECOSTRESS 35m shortwave resolution, while DHI will work on sharpening Sentinel-3, Sentinel-2 and ECOSTRESS imagery to obtain near-daily LST observations at high spatial resolution.
3. AECSIC will work on developing a data-driven model to estimate crop yield of maize (interest in South Africa) and rice (interest in Burkina Faso), using in situ data from Spain.

## Closure.
The meeting was concluded at 9:30.
