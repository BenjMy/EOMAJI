# EO-MAJI Kick Off Meeting - Minutes.

## Introduction.
The meeting was held online using AECSIC's CONECTA videoconference platform. The beginning of the session was slightly delayed due to connection/access problems to the platform. The attendants to the meeting were:

* Zoltan Szantoi, ESA Technical Officer.
* Maria Pilar Martin, AECSIC.
* Vicente Burchard-Levine, AECSIC.
* Héctor Nieto, AECSIC.
* Darren Ghent, University of Leicester.
* Radoslaw Guzinski, DHI.

Each attendant briefly introduced him/herself, in addition two additional key-personnel were mentioned whom could not attend to the meeting: Mike Perry (University of Leicester) and Michael Munk (DHI).

## Poject introduction and Project management.
A short overview of the project main objectives and workpackages was presented. Due to recurrent problems with the CONECTA online platform, we switched to a MS Teams room created by DHI.

We discussed about the access of the European ECOSTRESS Hub and clarified that the reason we did not mention its use in the proposal was due to the inability of getting timely access to the FS-TEP platform. We expressed a mutual concern of the support provided by FS-TEP and was mentioned that some actions will be taken in order to improve the performance of the EEH, that might include mirroring the EEH in another platform besides of FS-TEP.

During the introducton of the African partners, Zoltan Szantoi asked about how fluent the communication is with the Early Adopters. We reckoned some initial issues in getting one of the partners fully involved, but this is now fixed and all the key personnel in Africa are now fully involved and responsive. On this topic, Radoslaw Guzinski mentioned the key participation of Michael Munk in the outreach and EA engagement tasks, as he has a vast experience with African entities and he is also involved in the RAMONA project.

Regarding the project website, there is a neccesity to link the EOMAJI website that we will develop with the official EO Africa website hosted by ESA. To that regard, we are free to design our own logo.

Finally, we showed the project's chronogram and approved that the milestone and deliverable schedule is set with the **1st of December 2022 as starting date of the project activities**.
  
## Collaboration/synergies with other EO Africa initiatives.
A short list of possible synergies with other EO Africa initiatives were presented. In addition, under the African context we also highlighted the participation of project members in other ESA funded projects with focus in Africa: RAMONA, ET4FAO and WorldWater. **A common interest in scientific collaboration with other EOAFRICA Explorers projects** was expressed by all parties in the meeting. Indeed, Zoltan Szantoi listed the other EO Africa projects currently running, with a short overview of geographical extent and main objectives.

## Future steps and meetings.
We discussed the possiblity of using part of the T&A budget that was not used for this Kick-Off Meeting for holding a face-to-face meeting. One option would be to have a hybrid face-to-face and online meeting in ESRIN for MS-1. Also, Zoltan Szantoi remarked the neccessity of **holding a meeting in Africa**, leaving open when and where this should happen. In any case, **the final meeting (MS-4) should be in ESRIN**.

In addition, it is possible that a small-scale workshop with the other EOAfrica projects was organized after the International Workshop on High-Resolution Thermal EO (https://thermal2023.esa.int/), should the majority of the EOAfrica projects were presenting/attending to it.

Due to issues found with the videoconference platform that was used during this metting, it was agreed that next online meetings, such as progress reports, will be held using any standard platform. **Héctor Nieto will contact AECSIC's IT support for the possiblity of accessing to Microsoft Teams, but DHI has a licence for TEAM and could create the online room otherwise**.

Finally, we also pointed out that we will schedule a joint meeting with all the African partners by January 2023. We will send the invite to Zoltan Szantoi in case he could attend.

## Any Other Business.
Before concluding the meeting, some other quesitons and comemnts were raised. Pilar Martin asked whether there was any plans for upcoming airborne campaigns related to ECOSTRESS/PRISMA and/or LSTM/CHIME. Zoltan Szantoi expressed that he did not know, but Radoslaw Guzinski mentionend that as far as he know a airborne campaign will be done in Grosetto as part of the LSTM cal/val activitites. Finally Zoltan Szantoi suggested not to carbon copy emails regarding scientifi-technical matters to Dora Tamas. We agree on that and that will carbon-copy to Francesco Palazzo as he will assist Zoltan with technical tasks.
