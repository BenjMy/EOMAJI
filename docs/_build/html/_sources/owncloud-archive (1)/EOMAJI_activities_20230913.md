# Highlights
* MS1 achieved with the submission of the corresponding revised deliverables.

# Upcoming Key Activities for the next 3 months
* A CCN will be submitted to ESA to propose University of Leicester as prime to facilitate the payments with the subcontractors.

* The rainfed water balance model (FEST-EWB) will be implemented, in collaboration with Politecnico of Milano, as baseline for irrigation accounting.

# Key Activities in the past 3 months
* A validation of TSEB was performed over ICOS sites using ECOSTRESS LST and CGLS LAI. The results provided sensitive improvement to the TSEB product derived for EEH and published recenntly by Hu et al. (2023). The improvement in LE and H are due to a finer parametrization of the model using global datasets, such as GEDI canopy height for forests and other structural variables based on land cover.

* PRISMA imagery sowed some geometric inconsistencies. For that reason, an automatic procedure for corregistering PRISMA imagery has been tested in Majadas site (SPAIN).

* We are evaluating the potential of SWIR data to separate the photosynthetic and non-phosynthetic fractions of herbaceous covers. So far the method has been applied using in situ above ground biomass measurements over the Majadas site. This approach has bee appklied using hyperspectral data from both proximal spectroradiometry and PRISMA imagery. In addition, we are also evaluating how the approach could be transferred to Sentinel-2 multiespectral data, from which a MSc thesis is going to be submitted soon.

* An exploratory analysis was carried out to find the most relevant biophysical traits and stress metrics that are better related to yield of wheat, barley, rice and maize, reported from the Spanish ESYRCE database. The models that better predict yield where based on temporal aggregates of Sentinel-2 imagery for LAI, leaf biomass and Canopy Chlorophyll Content, as well as the difference between actual and potential ET.
