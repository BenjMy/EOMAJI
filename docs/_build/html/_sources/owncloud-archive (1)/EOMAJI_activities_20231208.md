# Highlights (if any, Oct-Dec, 2023)
* ICA-CSIC supervised a MSc Thesis on the use of Sentinel-2 biophysical traits to estimate crop yield in wheat and barley.
* Sentinel-2 data was processed to derive biophysical traits since 2017 over all ICOS sites in Europe. The aim is to extend the validation/implementation of TSEB model with ECOSTRESS data done at https://doi.org/10.1029/2022WR034132, and see whether biophysical traits from Sentinel-2 would provide any added value to the CGLS LAI at 300m evaluated previously.
* A new postdoc, Benjamin Mary, was hired at ICA-CSIC by mid-November. Ben is expert in geophysics and data assimilation and he will participate in the implementation of the water balance model for accouting irrigation.
* We keep downloading all PRISMA images available in the African and Spanish study sites and pre-processed the temporal series on Majadas site.
* Co-registration using an automated open-source Python code originally designed to co-register airborne mosaics (https://github.com/hectornieto/airborne_tools) was succesfully evaluated to PRISMA and Sentinel-2 imagery.
* Filtering PRISMA atmospheric water absorption bands and noisy spectral bands by comparison with ground-based spectra acquired in sampling campaigns  using an ASD FieldSpec 3 spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices Inc., Boulder, Co, USA) covering a 400-2400 nm spectral range.
* Exploratory analysis of the in situ data set closest to the PRISMA acquisitions including above ground biomass (AGB), and leaf area index (LAI) for total, green and dry fractions. Empirical models to estimate the abovementioned variables have been exploresd using PRISMA original bands, resampled bands (1nm) and vegetation indices.
 

# Key Activities for the next three months(Jan-March 2024)
* Run TSEB using Sentinel-2 & ECOSTRESS + Landsat over ICOS sites.
* Benjamin Mary (ICA-CSIC) has been invted to a talk at the 3rd Agrogeophysics seminar in Zurich. There he will present the synergies between soil geophysics and remote sensing to retrieve root-zone soil moisture and evaluate irrigation.
* A new PhD student, Miguel Herrezuelo, will join ICA-CSIC by January 2024 to support the activitities related to crop yield monitoring.
* CCHS-CSIC postdoc, Mª Dolores Raya, will visit the Remote Sensing of Environmental Dynamics Laboratory (Laboratorio di Telerilevamento delle Dinamiche Ambientali, LDTA) at the University of Milano – Bicocca (Italy) for two months (January-February) to to gain new knowledge in the pre-processing of PRISMA imagery (atmospheric corrections and alternative filtering methods) and exploring new methodologies for the estimation of plant traits (including photosynthetic and non photosynthetic fractions) through RTMs and/or hybrid models. 

# Workshops and conferences (if any, Oct-Dec, 2023)
* Vicente Burchard attended the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Open Science Conference 2023 in Kigali, Rwanda and had meetings with partners of EO Africa R&D facility, taking of advantage of Face to Face course
 

# Changes in reporting period (Oct-Dec, 2023)
Most of the activities by EO-MAJI members have been put in "slow motion". Hopefully Dora would get the documentation ready regarding the change of prime to University of Leicester and we will be back in full speed. In addition, Radoslaw Guzinski (lead at DHI) is now on parental leave until April 2024, and Michael Munk will take over during that period.
