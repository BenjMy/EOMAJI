# Highlights
Vicente Burchard (AECSIC) was awarded with an EOAfrica R+D Facility parnership in collaboration with Getachew Mehabie Mulualem, of the Bahir Dar University in Ethiopia. The project is entitled "A composite drought indicator for the Borana rangelands in Ethiopia combining multi-sourced Earth Observation data and the three-source energy balance model: A support to the Index Based Insurance for Pastoralists in Ethiopia" and it aims at producing ET estimates with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 over the Borana region.

# Upcoming Key Activities for the next 3 months
* According to the feedback received by ESA, we are just now finalizing the revision of deliverables that were submitted for MS1. 

* An exploratory analysis of the most relevant EO metrics that showed best correlation to crop yield is being performed by using crop yield data provided by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture.

* A rainfed water balance model (FEST-EWB) will be implemented, in collaboration with Politecnico of Milano, as baseline for irrigation accounting.

* An automatic procedure for geocollocating PRIMSA imagery will be tested.

* We are evaluating the potential of Sentinel-2 SWIR data to separate the photosynthetic and non-phosynthetic fractions of herbaceous covers. This approach could be transferred to PRISMA imagery.


# Key Activities in the past 3 months
* The first version of deliverables D01-D06 and D17 were submitted to ESA on 28 April, which was follwed by MS1 meeting scheduled on 4 May.

* Hector Nieto (AECSIC) and Radoslaw Guzinski (DHI) attended the ThermalEO 2023 workshop on 10-12 May. EOMAJI was introduced to the audience with an oral presentation entitled "Continuous monitoring of crop water use and productivity by fusing ECOSTRESS, PRISMA and Sentinels as part of the EOAfricaâ€™s Explorers initiative".

* We have given support to a technician of the Ministry of Agriculture of Burkina Faso in running pyTSEB for producing EO ET maps over the Kou Valley.

* All archived PRISMA imagery has been downloaded for the different AOIs of Burkina Faso, Botswana, South Africa and Spain.
  
# Upcoming workshops for the next 3 months
We do not foresee the attendance to any workshop in the next months.
