# Highlights
The EOMAJI project (Earth Observation system to Manage Africa’s food systems by Joint-knowledge of crop production and Irrigation digitization) will make use of a thermal-based energy balance model model (TSEB), to evaluate ET with inputs from the scientific ECOSTRESS and PRISMA missions, as an exploration of the capabilities for future operational satellite missions in deriving improved ET as well as yield/biomass and irrigation products. This will also allow acquiring a better understanding of water use efficiency of cultivated landscapes. 

Both intermediate (ET, crop traits) and final products (crop productivity and yield, as well as irrigation delimitation and accounting) will be evaluated against available in situ measurements collected outside Africa, in already running long-term experimental sites (Majadas de Tietar FLUXNET site in Spain and other ICOS sites), as well as in African sites in collaboration with African Early Adopters (Ministry of Agriculture of Burkina Faso and the Ministry Lands and Water Affairs of Botswana). Together with CSIR and University of Pretoria of South Africa, we foresee to exploit existing crop yield and irrigation reports that are acquired by those institutions to validate project outputs.

# Upcoming Key Activities for the next 3 months
With the AOIs already defined we are starting the acquisition of Sentinel and Landsat imagery that will complement the ECOSTRESS+PRISMA timeseries. On the other hand, we will perform a literature review of the state-of-the art of EO algorithms for yield prediction and irrigation accounting. In parallel, we are running crop model simulations using Daisy code (https://daisy.ku.dk/) to evaluate the sensitivity of crop water stress metrics on yield. Regarding the use of hyperspectral data, we are running exploratory analyses in order to evaluate the ability of hyperspectral data to track the non-photosynthetic vegetation, using in-situ data collected in the Majadas de Tiétar site. Finally, we will work on the development of the Jacobian form for the TSEB model, which will allow accounting for the input uncertainty propagation into the ET model.

Regarding outreach and African Early Adopter engagement, we are planning an online meeting with all African partners EOMAJI scheduled for early January, in order to better define their needs and user requirements.

# Past Key Activities in the past 3 months – including workshops with details
An overview of the project was presented during the 2nd Workshop on International Cooperation in Spaceborne Imaging Spectroscopy, that was held in Frascati from 19 to 21 October 2021. The oral presentation was entitled "Improvement of crop water use and crop productivity using PRISMA hyperspectral data as part of the EOAfrica’s Explorers initiative" and was primarily focused on the EOMAJI's activities centered on PRISMA data.

As for specific technical tasks, we have gathered eddy covariance data for the validation of the ET product from the ICOS and European Fluxes Database Cluster. In addition, in synergy with the ET4FAO project lead by DHI, we have also access to some limited Eddy Covariance data in Africa. A preliminary analysis of the performance of TSEB model to estimate instantaneous latent and sensible heat fluxes has been already applied using ECOSTRESS timeseries, extracted from the NASA AppEEARS toolkit. Furthermore, contacts has been made with the LIST group responsible of the European ECOSTRESS Hub (EEH), in order to joint efforts in modelling and validating evapotranspiration with ECOSTRESS imagery processed at the EEH. On the other hand, we have collected archived PRISMA data over our study sites: Majadas del Tiétar and Barrax sites in Spain and the corresponding AOIs of our African partners. Currently we are working on evaluating the geometric and radiometric quality of PRIMSA images. Finally, we have requested access to yield data at the Ministries of Agriculture of Spain and Burkina Faso. In Burkina Faso we have access to rice yield data since 2018 over selected parcels in the Kou Valley Irrigation Scheme. As for Spain, we obtained access to the ESYRCE database that reports annual yield data sampled within a 1km grid in the country.

# Upcoming Workshops
We are planning to submit an abstract to the International Workshop on High-Resolution Thermal EO, which will be held in ESA-ESRIN from 10 to 12 May 2023.
