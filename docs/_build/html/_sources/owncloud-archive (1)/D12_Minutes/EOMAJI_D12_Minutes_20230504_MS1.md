# EO-MAJI Milestone 1 Meeting - Minutes.

## Introduction.
The meeting was held online using DHI's Microsoft Teams videoconference subscription. The meeting started at 9:00. The attendants to the meeting were:

* Zoltan Szantoi, ESA Technical Officer.
* Maria Pilar Martin, AECSIC.
* Vicente Burchard-Levine, AECSIC.
* HÃ©ctor Nieto, AECSIC.
* Darren Ghent, University of Leicester.
* Radoslaw Guzinski, DHI.

HN welcomed everybody and mentioned that the deliverables were sent to ZS on Friday. Since the delivery was not done 10 days prior the meeting, neither ZS nor his colleagues had time to read them before the meeting. Then HN explained that this MS1 meetings will review one by one each deliverable submitted. The presenter of the deliverable will be the main responsible for each of them, letting other contributors to take the word if needed.

## D02: Early Adopters Characterization and Benefit Analysis Report
RG presented the main contents of this deliverable. During the presentation ZS marked the interests of having different irrigation systems in each Area of Interest. In addition ZS also pointed out the interest of using ET for irrigation mapping as novelty of the study.

While presenting the product specifications, ZS asked, out of curiosity, why the irrigation accounting would have 4 months timeliness, as opposed to 1 month timeliness of the other two products. HN clarified that was due to the need for applying a water balance model using best quality rainfall data, such as ERA5 reanalysis which is usually provided with three months delay, plus an extra month for processing the algorithm.

Finally, ZS also suggested that we could take a look at the WorldCereal global irrigation map, as product baseline.

## D03: State-of-the-Art Review
HN presented this topic. Once the presentation finished ZS pointed out the current interest of having irrigation accounting, not only in Africa but also in Europe, as this information is gaining importance.

On the other hand, ZS mentioned that DAIS data might be available to complement PRISMA data. We pointed out our interest of having access to this data, as PM will be working on hyperspectral data for characterizing the non-photosynthetic vegetation.

## D94: Policy Traceability Matrix
DG presented this section, which for us was the most difficult to comply as we never had to provide a deliverable of these characteristics. Therefore the provided document could be considered as work in progress/draft. DG presented the different societal needs, public policies and linked EO products we could provided.

Since DG mentioned the NEPAD Environment Ecosystems and Action Plan, ZS mentioned that if needed, he has a direct contact there he could share in case we need a connection there. DG appreciated the suggestion.

With the end of the presentation, DG, on behalf of the EOMAJI group asked whether the information provided is what ESA was expecting from this deliverable. ZS mentioned that their plan is to gather and synthesize all the Policy Traceability Matrices provided by the different EXPLORERS projects and get some conclusions. After that they will send us the feedback on this deliverable.

## D05: Agile Development Plan
RG introduced the AGP key points and principles. ZS had no further comments.

## D06: Validation Methodology
DG showed the main contents of the Validation Methodology document. Due to the difficulty in obtaining some of the in situ measurements required for product validation in Africa, as an alternative DG mentioned that we could look outside the AOIs (particularly for LST and ET products).

## D07: Communication website
HN showed the draft website that we have developed. So far it is hosted at the GitHub pages, open to the public at https://hectornieto.github.io/eomaji/. But once we have the approval by ESA we could host the webpage either at DHI or AECSIC web services. ZS suggested to take a look at the Explorer's ARIES webpage at https://eoafrica-aries.org/en for naming convention.

ZS asked as well as whether we should develop a specific logo for EOMAJI. He will ask ESA's colleagues if this is required, and contact all EO Africa EXPLORERS project leaders on that regard.

## End of Meeting
After presenting all the deliverables for this first milestone, ZS remind us that now they will read the documents and provide some feedback and7Or give the approval of the documents in the next weeks. Once the deliverables are approved we could invoice the first payment to ESA.

The meeting ended around 11:00 (CEST).
