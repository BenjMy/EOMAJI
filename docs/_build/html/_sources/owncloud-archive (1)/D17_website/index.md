The primary objective of this [EO Africa](https://eo4society.esa.int/eo-africa/) Explorers project is to utilize the unique spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics of ECOSTRESS thermal sensor and PRISMA hyperspectral sensor to develop novel methods addressing the growing challenges affecting the nexus of water resource management and food security in Africa. Irrigated agriculture is right in the centre of those two domains and the project monitors irrigation schemes with the aim of inventorying existing perimeters and improving their performance, enhancing the management of water licensing and permits and laying ground for sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in Africa. This will be achieved through development and application of state-of-the-art evapotranspiration modelling making full use of ECOSTRESS and PRISMA data.
