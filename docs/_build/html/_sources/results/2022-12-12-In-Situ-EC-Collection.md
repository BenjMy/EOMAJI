We have gathered eddy covariance data for the validation of the ET product from the ICOS and European Fluxes Database Cluster. In addition, in synergy with the ET4FAO project lead by DHI, we have also access to some limited Eddy Covariance data in Africa.

On the other hand, we have collected archived PRISMA data over our study sites: Majadas del Ti√©tar and Barrax sites in Spain and the corresponding AOIs of our African partners. Currently we are working on evaluating the geometric and radiometric quality of PRIMSA images. 

Finally, in Burkina Faso we have access to rice yield data since 2018 over selected parcels in the Kou Valley Irrigation Scheme. As for Spain, we obtained access to the ESYRCE database that reports annual yield data sampled within a ca. 5km grid in the country.
