With the JupyterLab MyST extension, you can also open and preview a markdown file as you are working on it. This will open up in real time and show you the updates! ðŸŽ‰

:::{important}
To see the frontmatter, you must enable the settings as JupyterLab automatically removes the frontmatter before passing it to the renderer! ([#14772](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/14772)).

ðŸ›  Settings > Search for `Frontmatter` > Enable Frontmatter.

Changing the markdown document should now work!
:::

The markdown document can use any of the same roles and directives from MyST with hover-previews. Any document, including notebooks, can be exported to a PDF document.
